ConParse v1.0 - Parser for BlackBerry Messenger .con (contact) files

ConParse is able to parse and generate reports from a BlackBerry Messenger .con file.  This file is generally only found on devices that are running 
BlackBerry Messenger 5.0 and above.  To generate this file, you need to select "Back up contacts locally" on the device.  Then, a .con file is saved
to either the Media Card or the device memory.  Usually, it will have a file name similar to "BBM-(YY-MM-DD).con"

To run ConParse, you can run the convenience launcher files included (cparse.bat and cparse.sh)

For example, to parse the "sheran.con" file:

--
azazel:conparse sheran$ ./cparse.sh sheran.con

bbt.py v0.4b - Parser for BlackBerry ThumbsxxxXxxx.key file

bbt will read a BlackBerry "key" thumbnail file and print out the record id of each thumbnail and corresponding offset of the record found inside the "dat" file.  bbt
will also read the older BBThumbs.dat file found on devices pre OS5

Usage: bbt.py [options]
  -h, --help: This cruft
  -k, --key <bbthumbs key file>: Process post OS5 thumbs.key file (requires thumbs.dat file in same directory)
  -b, --bbthumbs <old bbthumbs file>: Process pre OS5 BBThumbs.dat file
  -x, --extract: Extracts the thumbnails into directory specified by -o
  -o, --output <output directory>: Directory to extract thumbs to (used only with -x)
  -l, --local: Express timestamps in local time as opposed to GMT

Example 1: python bbt.py -k thumbs76x76.key -x -o output

The above example processes the files thumbs76x76.key and thumbs76x76.dat in the current directory, creates a directory named "output" 
and extracts all thumbnails into this directory.

Example 2: python bbt.py -b BBThumbs.dat -x -o output

The above example processes the file BBThumbs.dat in the current directory, creates a directory named "output" 
and extracts all thumbnails into this directory.

This repo no longer has any tools under it.  I have moved them to individual repos:

bbt - Script to parse out thumbs.key files copied from BlackBerry devices https://github.com/sheran/bbt
evt2sqlite - Tool to convert BlackBerry event log files into SQLite databases for easy analysis https://github.com/sheran/evt2sqlite
conparse - Tool to parse out the BlackBerry Messenger Contact Backup file -- BBM-(YY-MM-DD).con https://github.com/sheran/ConParse
